# Boston House Prices Prediction

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict house prices in Boston based on various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and more. The goal is to analyze the data, build a regression model, and evaluate its performance using R-squared and adjusted R-squared metrics. The trained model is also pickled for deployment.

## Project Overview

The Boston House Prices dataset is used to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston suburbs. This involves:
1. Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
2. Building a regression model to make predictions.
3. Evaluating model performance using R-squared and Adjusted R-squared.
4. Saving the trained model using `pickle` for deployment.
